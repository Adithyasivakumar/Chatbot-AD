# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
   - Classification: Predicting categories
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning without labeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature space

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment
   - Agent takes actions and receives rewards
   - Goal is to maximize cumulative reward

## Key Concepts

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting corrupted data
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing data ranges
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features
- **Data Splitting**: Train, validation, and test sets

### Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Cross-Validation**: Technique to assess model generalization

### Popular Algorithms
1. **Linear Regression**: Simple predictive modeling
2. **Logistic Regression**: Classification algorithm
3. **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model for decisions
4. **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
5. **Support Vector Machines**: Finding optimal decision boundaries
6. **Neural Networks**: Inspired by biological neural networks

## Important Definitions

**Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

**Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

**Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balance between model's ability to minimize bias and variance.

**Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions.

**Feature Engineering**: Process of selecting and transforming variables for machine learning models.
