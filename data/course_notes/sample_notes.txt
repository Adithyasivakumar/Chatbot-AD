# Machine Learning Course Notes

## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models
   - Classification: Predicting categories (e.g., spam detection)
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature space

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment
   - Agent takes actions and receives rewards/penalties

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression: For predicting continuous values
- Logistic Regression: For binary classification
- Decision Trees: Easy to interpret, handles both classification and regression
- Random Forest: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- Support Vector Machines: Effective for high-dimensional data
- Neural Networks: Inspired by biological neurons, good for complex patterns

## Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers
- Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features
- Feature Selection: Choose relevant features
- Train/Test Split: Separate data for training and evaluation

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model generalization

## Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
- Solutions: Regularization, more data, feature selection
