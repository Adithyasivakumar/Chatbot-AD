## 📝 **QUESTION 2: Types of Machine Learning**  
**Q:** What are the different types of machine learning? Explain each type with their characteristics.

**A:** Based on your course notes:

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
   - Classification: Predicting categories
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning without labeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature space

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment
   - Agent takes actions and receives rewards
   - Goal is to maximize cumulative reward

## 📝 **QUESTION 3: Model Performance Issues**
**Q:** What is overfitting and underfitting in machine learning? Explain the difference.

**A:** Based on your course notes:

## Important Definitions

**Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

**Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

## 📝 **QUESTION 4: Data Preprocessing**
**Q:** Explain the key steps in data preprocessing for machine learning projects.

**A:** Based on your course notes:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting corrupted data
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing data ranges
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features
- **Data Splitting**: Train, validation, and test sets

## 📝 **QUESTION 5: Model Evaluation**
**Q:** What are the different model evaluation metrics? How do you calculate precision, recall, and F1-score?

**A:** Based on your course notes:

### Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Cross-Validation**: Technique to assess model generalization
